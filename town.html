<h3>May 2013, yes I know that was 5 years ago #SuperSenior</h3>
<p>I grew up not far from Athens. So close that my highschool prom was here, across from Snelling.Every year they continue to still have prom on campus at UGA. I even crashed my sister's prom back in 2015 when I was a sophmore. </p>

<h3> Winder is approximately 35 minutes away and is not a very large town. If any of you have ever driven to Atlanta from Athens, you drive straight through it. The town is so small we only have 2 high schools in the whole county.However, not the smallest from what we have heard about our fellow classmates. </h3>

<h3> I found an article that shows that my graduating class was just under 400 people, the highest the school had ever had at the time.
